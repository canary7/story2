Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets.

At the center of the Heart Nebula (IC 1805) lies the star cluster Melotte 15, which illuminates the gas that surrounds it and these tendrils of dust. Together with the Soul Nebula (IC 1848), they lie roughly 7,500 light-years away in Cassiopeia.
